In the following tasks you will use statistics and sequence alignment to analyze real COVID-19 world data.

- Load packages
```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(Biostrings)
library(msa)
library(msaR)
```

- Set your working directory
```{r include=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/ranbe/OneDrive - Technion/טכניון/לימודים/תואר שני/ביואינפורמטיקה/HW1")
```


## Task 1: Data Exploration, Cleaning, and Preparation

This task involves exploring the dataset, identifying missing or irrelevant data, and cleaning the dataset for further analysis.

### Step 1: Load the Dataset

Load the dataset `COVID19_line_list_data.csv` into R.

```{r load-data}
# Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows
covid_data <- read.csv("COVID19_line_list_data.csv")
```

### Step 2: Basic Dataset Overview

- How many rows and columns are in the dataset?
- What are the column names?

```{r dataset-overview}
# Write code to find the dimensions and column names
dim <- dim(covid_data)
dim 
col_names <- colnames(covid_data)
col_names
```

### Step 3: Identify Missing Data

- Calculate the percentage of missing values for each column.
- Visualize missing data with a bar plot.

```{r missing-data}
# Write code to calculate and visualize missing data
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Calculate the percentage of missing values for each column in covid_data
missing_percentage <- colSums(is.na(covid_data)) / nrow(covid_data) * 100

# Create a data frame for visualization
missing_data <- data.frame(
  Column = names(missing_percentage),
  MissingPercentage = missing_percentage
)

# Visualize the missing data with a bar plot
ggplot(missing_data, aes(x = Column, y = MissingPercentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of Missing Values by Column in COVID Data",
    x = "Column",
    y = "Missing Percentage (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

### Step 4: Handle Missing Data

- Identify columns with more than 50% missing data and remove them.

```{r handle-missing-data}
# Write code to handle missing data

# Ensure the dataset is a tibble for tidyverse compatibility
covid_data <- as_tibble(covid_data)

# Calculate the percentage of missing values for each column
missing_percentage <- covid_data %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ mean(is.na(.)) * 100)) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "column", values_to = "missing_percentage")

# Identify columns with more than 50% missing data
columns_to_remove <- missing_percentage %>%
  filter(missing_percentage > 50) %>%
  pull(column)

# Remove columns with more than 50% missing data using dplyr explicitly
covid_data_cleaned <- covid_data %>%
  dplyr::select(-all_of(columns_to_remove))

# Print the names of removed columns
cat("Removed columns with more than 50% missing data:", paste(columns_to_remove, collapse = ", "), "\n")

# Summary of the cleaned dataset
print(dim(covid_data_cleaned))
```

### Step 5: Convert Date Columns to Proper Format

- Convert `reporting date` and `symptom onset` columns to date format.
- Create a new column calculating the difference between `reporting date` and `symptom onset`.
Note: Some dates state the year as 19/20 instead of 2019/2020
```{r date-conversion}
# Write code to convert date columns and calculate the difference
covid_data_cleaned <- covid_data_cleaned %>%
  mutate(
    reporting_date = as.Date(sub("(\\d{2})$", "20\\1", reporting.date), format = "%m/%d/%Y"),
    symptom_onset = as.Date(sub("(\\d{2})$", "20\\1", symptom_onset), format = "%m/%d/%Y"),
    date_difference = as.numeric(reporting_date - symptom_onset)
  )

head(covid_data_cleaned)
```

### Step 6: Summary Statistics of Cleaned Data

- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, min, max) for numeric columns.
- Count the number of cases by gender.

```{r summary-stats}
# Write code to generate summary statistics
numeric_summary <- summary(covid_data_cleaned[sapply(covid_data_cleaned, is.numeric)])
print(numeric_summary)

# Count cases by gender
gender_count <- table(covid_data_cleaned$gender)
print(gender_count)

```

### Step 7: Data Visualization

- Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of ages in the dataset.
- Generate a bar plot to show the number of cases by gender.

```{r data-visualization}
# Write code to create the histogram and bar plot
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))  # Split plot area into 1 row and 2 columns

# Histogram
hist(covid_data_cleaned$age,  main = "Age Distribution",  xlab = "Age",  col = "lightblue",  las = 1)

# Bar Plot
barplot(gender_count, main = "Number of Cases by Gender", xlab = "Gender", ylab = "Number of Cases", col = c("lightpink", "lightblue"),  las = 1)

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))  # Reset plot area to single plot

```

### Step 8: Filter Data for Specific Conditions

- Filter the dataset to include only cases from China where the patient has recovered.
- Calculate the average age of recovered patients in this subset.

```{r filter-data}
# Write code to filter data and calculate the average age

average_age <- covid_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(country == "China", recovered == 1) %>%
  summarize(avg_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(avg_age)

print(paste("The average age of recovered patients in China is:", round(average_age, 2)))

```

## Task 2: Statistical Analysis

This task involves testing a hypothesis related to COVID-19 data. The goal is to assess whether the average age of patients who recovered differs significantly from those who did not recover.

### Step 1: Formulate the Hypothesis

Before running the test, answer the following in free text:

1. **What is the null hypothesis?**  
2. **What is the alternative hypothesis?**  
3. **What type of data are we working with? (e.g., categorical, numerical, etc.)**  
4. **How do we assess the normality of the data?**  
5. **How should the test statistics and p-value be interpreted?**

**Write your answers here as free text:**


### Step 2: Data Preparation

- Filter the data into two groups: recovered and non-recovered patients.
- Remove rows with missing values in the `age` column.
Note: Any value other than zero in the "recovered" column means that the patient didn't die.

```{r data-prep}
# Write code to filter and clean the data
```

### Step 3: Assess Normality

- Use a histogram and a Shapiro-Wilk test to assess the normality of age distribution for both groups.

```{r normality-test}
# Write code to assess normality
```

1. **Does the Shapiro-Wilk test results indicated that the data follow a normal distributions?**  
2. **How does it affect our choice of statistical test?**  

**Write your answers here as free text:**

### Step 4: Perform a Mann-Whitney U Test

```{r mann-whitney-test}
# Write code to perform a Mann-Whitney U test
```

### Step 5: Visualize the Results with Boxplots

- Create a boxplot to visualize the age distribution for recovered and non-recovered groups.
- Display the p-value above the boxplot.

```{r boxplot-visualization}
# Write code to create the boxplot and annotate with the p-value
```

### Step 6: Interpret the Results

In free text, answer the following questions:

1. **Was the null hypothesis rejected?**  
2. **What do the test statistic and p-value tell us?**  
3. **Is there evidence to suggest a difference in mean age between the groups?**

## Task 3: Analyzing COVID-19 Mortality and Human Development Index (HDI)

In this task, we will explore the hypothesis that countries with a high Human Development Index (HDI) have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19.

### Step 1: Load the Data

- Read "owid-covid-data.csv" from the URL into a variable called `covid_world`.

```{r}
# Enter your code here:
covid_world <- read.csv("owid-covid-data.csv")
covid_world
```

### Step 2: Take a Look at the Data

- View the dataset.

```{r include=FALSE}
View(covid_world)
```


### Step 3: Create a Subset for Analysis

- Do the following using pipes ("%>%" or "|>") followed by the correct functions from the `tidyverse` package.
- Make a second table and call it `covid_hdi_vs_deaths`:
  1. Keep rows where `date` is equal to "2021-11-08".
  2. Select the columns: `"location"`, `"human_development_index"`, `"population"`, `"total_deaths"`.
  3. Remove rows with `NA` values.
  4. Add a column `total_deaths_per_million` that normalize the total death in each country per million (round the final value).

```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```


### Step 4: Visualize the Relationship

- Create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between HDI and `total_deaths_per_million`.
- Add a linear regression line to the plot using `geom_smooth`

```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```

### Step 5: Calculate Correlations

- Calculate the **Pearson** and **Spearman** correlation coefficients between HDI and `total_deaths_per_million`.

```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```


### Step 6: Interpret the Correlation

- Report the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, the strength (weak/moderate/strong/very strong), and the direction (positive/negative).

**Write your answers here as free text:**


### Step 7: Assess the Claim

- Do you agree with the claim that increased HDI causes higher COVID-19 mortality? Write a detailed explanation.

**Write your answers here as free text:**


### Step 8: Find Another Feature

- Find another feature in `covid_world` that might explain the correlation between HDI and COVID-19 mortality.
- Plot this feature as in step 4.


```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```

### Step 9: Explain the New Finding

- Write your explanation for the relationship you found.
