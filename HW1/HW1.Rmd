In the following tasks you will use statistics and sequence alignment to analyze real COVID-19 world data.

- Load packages
```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(Biostrings)
library(msa)
library(msaR)
```

- Set your working directory
```{r include=FALSE}

```


## Task 1: Data Exploration, Cleaning, and Preparation

This task involves exploring the dataset, identifying missing or irrelevant data, and cleaning the dataset for further analysis.

### Step 1: Load the Dataset

Load the dataset `COVID19_line_list_data.csv` into R.

```{r load-data}
# Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows
```

### Step 2: Basic Dataset Overview

- How many rows and columns are in the dataset?
- What are the column names?

```{r dataset-overview}
# Write code to find the dimensions and column names
```

### Step 3: Identify Missing Data

- Calculate the percentage of missing values for each column.
- Visualize missing data with a bar plot.

```{r missing-data}
# Write code to calculate and visualize missing data
```

### Step 4: Handle Missing Data

- Identify columns with more than 50% missing data and remove them.

```{r handle-missing-data}
# Write code to handle missing data
```

### Step 5: Convert Date Columns to Proper Format

- Convert `reporting date` and `symptom onset` columns to date format.
- Create a new column calculating the difference between `reporting date` and `symptom onset`.
Note: Some dates state the year as 19/20 instead of 2019/2020
```{r date-conversion}
# Write code to convert date columns and calculate the difference
```

### Step 6: Summary Statistics of Cleaned Data

- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, min, max) for numeric columns.
- Count the number of cases by gender.

```{r summary-stats}
# Write code to generate summary statistics
```

### Step 7: Data Visualization

- Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of ages in the dataset.
- Generate a bar plot to show the number of cases by gender.

```{r data-visualization}
# Write code to create the histogram and bar plot
```

### Step 8: Filter Data for Specific Conditions

- Filter the dataset to include only cases from China where the patient has recovered.
- Calculate the average age of recovered patients in this subset.

```{r filter-data}
# Write code to filter data and calculate the average age
```

## Task 2: Statistical Analysis

This task involves testing a hypothesis related to COVID-19 data. The goal is to assess whether the average age of patients who recovered differs significantly from those who did not recover.

### Step 1: Formulate the Hypothesis

Before running the test, answer the following in free text:

1. **What is the null hypothesis?**  
2. **What is the alternative hypothesis?**  
3. **What type of data are we working with? (e.g., categorical, numerical, etc.)**  
4. **How do we assess the normality of the data?**  
5. **How should the test statistics and p-value be interpreted?**

**Write your answers here as free text:**


### Step 2: Data Preparation

- Filter the data into two groups: recovered and non-recovered patients.
- Remove rows with missing values in the `age` column.
Note: Any value other than zero in the "recovered" column means that the patient didn't die.

```{r data-prep}
# Write code to filter and clean the data
```

### Step 3: Assess Normality

- Use a histogram and a Shapiro-Wilk test to assess the normality of age distribution for both groups.

```{r normality-test}
# Write code to assess normality
```

1. **Does the Shapiro-Wilk test results indicated that the data follow a normal distributions?**  
2. **How does it affect our choice of statistical test?**  

**Write your answers here as free text:**

### Step 4: Perform a Mann-Whitney U Test

```{r mann-whitney-test}
# Write code to perform a Mann-Whitney U test
```

### Step 5: Visualize the Results with Boxplots

- Create a boxplot to visualize the age distribution for recovered and non-recovered groups.
- Display the p-value above the boxplot.

```{r boxplot-visualization}
# Write code to create the boxplot and annotate with the p-value
```

### Step 6: Interpret the Results

In free text, answer the following questions:

1. **Was the null hypothesis rejected?**  
2. **What do the test statistic and p-value tell us?**  
3. **Is there evidence to suggest a difference in mean age between the groups?**

## Task 3: Analyzing COVID-19 Mortality and Human Development Index (HDI)

In this task, we will explore the hypothesis that countries with a high Human Development Index (HDI) have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19.

### Step 1: Load the Data

- Read "owid-covid-data.csv" from the URL into a variable called `covid_world`.

```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```

### Step 2: Take a Look at the Data

- View the dataset.

```{r include=FALSE}
View(covid_world)
```


### Step 3: Create a Subset for Analysis

- Do the following using pipes ("%>%" or "|>") followed by the correct functions from the `tidyverse` package.
- Make a second table and call it `covid_hdi_vs_deaths`:
  1. Keep rows where `date` is equal to "2021-11-08".
  2. Select the columns: `"location"`, `"human_development_index"`, `"population"`, `"total_deaths"`.
  3. Remove rows with `NA` values.
  4. Add a column `total_deaths_per_million` that normalize the total death in each country per million (round the final value).

```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```


### Step 4: Visualize the Relationship

- Create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between HDI and `total_deaths_per_million`.
- Add a linear regression line to the plot using `geom_smooth`

```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```

### Step 5: Calculate Correlations

- Calculate the **Pearson** and **Spearman** correlation coefficients between HDI and `total_deaths_per_million`.

```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```


### Step 6: Interpret the Correlation

- Report the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, the strength (weak/moderate/strong/very strong), and the direction (positive/negative).

**Write your answers here as free text:**


### Step 7: Assess the Claim

- Do you agree with the claim that increased HDI causes higher COVID-19 mortality? Write a detailed explanation.

**Write your answers here as free text:**


### Step 8: Find Another Feature

- Find another feature in `covid_world` that might explain the correlation between HDI and COVID-19 mortality.
- Plot this feature as in step 4.


```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```

### Step 9: Explain the New Finding

- Write your explanation for the relationship you found.

## Task 4 - Sequence Alignment

- Take a look at the "Biostrings" package vignettes
```{r include=FALSE}
browseVignettes("Biostrings")
```

- Download the file "covid_spike_variants.fasta" from the course website
This file contain the amino acids sequence of the COVID-19 spike protein from different variants

- Load the file using the correct function from the package "Biostrings" and assign to a variable called "variants"
```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```

- How many amina acids are in the Alpha variant?

**Write your answers here as free text:**


- Read the documentation for the Multiple Sequence Alignment (msa) function from the package "msa"
- Run MSA for the sequences in "variants" and assign the results to "variants.msa"
```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```


- Take a look at the results using the package "msaR" (notice: you can scroll right and left to see all the sequence)
```{r}
msaR(AAMultipleAlignment(variants.msa), colorscheme = "taylor")
```

- (1) Which amino-acids appear in position #26? (type "AMINO_ACID_CODE" in the console)
- (2) Write an example of a SNP that can cause the change in amino acid as we see in the Gamma variant

**Write your answers here as free text:**


Phylogenetic tree for the COVID19 variants:
- Use the package "seqinr" to generate a distance matrix from the MSA results
```{r include=FALSE}
# Enter your code here:
```

- Plot a phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) assembled by hierarchical clustering using the "ward.D" method
```{r}
# Enter your code here:
```


- Look at the phylogenetic tree and answer the following questions:
1. Which variant is most similar to the Beta variant?
2. Which pair of variants are the closest?
