## Setup  

#### Load Required Packages  
```{r}
# Set the working directory and load necessary packages
setwd('~/Documents/intro_to_bioinformatics/winter2425/tutorial_5/')
library(DESeq2)
library(tidyverse)
library(GEOquery)

## 1. Load Data  

#### Load Counts and Metadata  
```{r}
# Load RNA-Seq count matrix
counts <- read.table("../tutorial_4/GSE152418_p20047_Study1_RawCounts.txt.gz", 
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = '\t', 
                     header = TRUE, check.names = FALSE)

# Load metadata from GEO series matrix file
gse <- getGEO(filename = "../tutorial_4/GSE152418_series_matrix.txt") 

# Create a clean metadata table
metadata <- as_tibble(gse) %>% 
  dplyr::select(sample = title, disease = disease.state.ch1, 
                gender = gender.ch1, severity = severity.ch1) %>% 
  mutate(disease = ifelse(disease == "Convalescent", "COVID-19", disease)) %>% 
  mutate(disease = factor(disease, levels = c('Healthy', 'COVID-19')))

# Ensure metadata samples match column names in counts matrix
all(metadata$sample == colnames(counts)[-1])
```

## 2. Create DESeq2 Object and Run Analysis  

```{r}
# Create DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = metadata,
                              design = ~disease,
                              tidy = TRUE)

# Run DESeq2 differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Shrink Log2 Fold Change values using apeglm
resLFC <- lfcShrink(dds, coef = "disease_COVID.19_vs_Healthy", type = "apeglm")

# Add gene symbols to results
resLFC$symbol <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                        keys = rownames(resLFC),
                        column = "SYMBOL",
                        keytype = "ENSEMBL",
                        multiVals = "first")

# Order results by p-value
resOrdered <- resLFC[order(resLFC$pvalue),]

# Create DESeq2 object with gene symbols instead of ENSEMBL IDs
dds.symbol <- dds
rownames(dds.symbol) <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                               keys = rownames(dds),
                               column = "SYMBOL",
                               keytype = "ENSEMBL",
                               multiVals = "first")
rownames(dds.symbol)[is.na(rownames(dds.symbol))] <- rownames(dds)[is.na(rownames(dds.symbol))]
rownames(dds.symbol) <- make.unique(rownames(dds.symbol))
```


## 3. Results Visualization  

### Volcano Plot  
```{r}
EnhancedVolcano::EnhancedVolcano(resOrdered,
                lab = resOrdered$symbol,
                x = 'log2FoldChange',
                y = 'padj',
                labSize = 3,
                FCcutoff = 2)
```

### Heatmap  
```{r}
# Select top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes
selectUp <- resOrdered$symbol[resOrdered$log2FoldChange > 0][1:10]
selectDown <- resOrdered$symbol[resOrdered$log2FoldChange < 0][1:10]
select <- c(selectUp, selectDown)

# Prepare annotation data
df <- data.frame(row.names = colnames(dds.symbol),
                 disease = colData(dds.symbol)$disease,
                 severity = colData(dds.symbol)$severity,
                 gender = colData(dds.symbol)$gender)

# Get normalized counts
normcounts <- assay(vst(dds.symbol, blind = TRUE))

# Plot heatmap
pheatmap::pheatmap(normcounts[select,], cluster_rows = TRUE,
                   show_colnames = FALSE, cluster_cols = TRUE, 
                   annotation_col = df, scale = 'row', 
                   cutree_cols = 2, cutree_rows = 2)
```

### PCA Visualization  

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps us summarize the variance in a dataset.  
- PCA transforms the data into new dimensions called **Principal Components (PCs)**.  
- **PC-1** explains the largest variance in the data, followed by **PC-2**, **PC-3**, and so on.  
- By visualizing the data in the first few PCs, we can explore patterns, clusters, or outliers.  
- In gene expression analysis, PCA helps us observe how samples group based on their overall expression profiles.  

#### Steps for PCA Visualization

```{r}
# Select top 1000 most variable genes
var_per_gene <- apply(normcounts, 1, var)  # Calculate variance for each gene
selectedGenes <- names(var_per_gene[order(var_per_gene, decreasing = TRUE)][1:1000])  # Top 1000 variable genes
normcounts.top1Kvar <- t(normcounts[selectedGenes,])  # Transpose to make samples as rows

# Perform PCA
pcaResults <- prcomp(normcounts.top1Kvar, scale. = TRUE)  # Scale the data for PCA
```

#### 2D PCA Plot with Explained Variance

```{r}
# Calculate percentage of variance explained by PCs
percentVar <- round(100 * (pcaResults$sdev^2 / sum(pcaResults$sdev^2)), 2)

# Plot PCA with ggplot2
pcaData <- as.data.frame(pcaResults$x)
pcaData$disease <- dds$disease  # Add disease metadata

ggplot(pcaData, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = disease)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "PCA of Top 1000 Variable Genes",
       x = paste0("PC1 (", percentVar[1], "% Variance)"),
       y = paste0("PC2 (", percentVar[2], "% Variance)")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Another way to plot the PCA is to use an internal DESeq2 function:
```{r}
plotPCA(vst(dds.symbol,blind=T), ntop=1000, intgroup=c('disease','severity'))
```

#### Understanding Principal Components  
- PC1 separates samples based on the largest variation in the dataset.  
- PC2 is orthogonal to PC1 and explains the second-largest variance.  
- Together, PC1 and PC2 often capture a significant proportion of the total variance.  
- Subsequent PCs (e.g., PC3, PC4) capture less variance but may reveal subtler patterns.  

#### 3D PCA Plot

```{r}
# Create a 3D PCA plot
p <- plot_ly(pcaData, 
             x = ~PC1, 
             y = ~PC2, 
             z = ~PC3, 
             color = ~disease,
             colors = c('blue', 'red'),
             type = "scatter3d", 
             mode = "markers") %>%
     layout(title = "3D PCA Plot of Top 1000 Variable Genes",
            scene = list(
              xaxis = list(title = paste0("PC1 (", percentVar[1], "% Variance)")),
              yaxis = list(title = paste0("PC2 (", percentVar[2], "% Variance)")),
              zaxis = list(title = paste0("PC3 (", percentVar[3], "% Variance)"))
            ))

# Display the plot
p
```

## 4.1. Correlations  

Correlation measures how strongly two variables (e.g., gene expression values across samples) are related.  
- A **positive correlation** means that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well.  
- A **negative correlation** means that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.  
- Correlation values range from -1 to 1:  
  - **1**: Perfect positive correlation.  
  - **0**: No correlation (variables are unrelated).  
  - **-1**: Perfect negative correlation.  

Correlations are commonly used to understand similarities between genes or samples in datasets.  

### Correlation Between Two Samples  
Let's start by comparing the expression levels of two samples.  

```{r}
# Plot the expression values of two samples
plot(normcounts[,1], normcounts[,2], 
     main = "Gene Expression Correlation Between Two Samples", 
     xlab = "Sample 1 Expression", 
     ylab = "Sample 2 Expression")
```

- If the points form a diagonal line (upwards or downwards), the samples are strongly correlated.  
- A scattered cloud of points indicates weak or no correlation.  

```{r}
# Calculate correlation coefficient
cor(normcounts[,1], normcounts[,2])  # Overall correlation
cor(normcounts[selectedGenes,1], normcounts[selectedGenes,2])  # Correlation for top variable genes
```


### Correlation Matrix for All Samples  
A **correlation matrix** shows the correlation coefficients between all pairs of samples.  
```{r}
# Compute correlation matrix
correlationMatrix <- cor(normcounts[selectedGenes,])
head(correlationMatrix)  # View the first few rows
```

To visualize this, we can use a heatmap:  
```{r}
# Visualize correlation matrix with pheatmap
pheatmap::pheatmap(correlationMatrix,  
                   annotation_col = df, 
                   cutree_cols = 3, cutree_rows = 3, 
                   show_colnames = FALSE, show_rownames = FALSE,
                   main = "Sample Correlation Heatmap")
```



### Comparing Correlation to Other Metrics  
Correlation is one way to measure similarity, but we can also use other metrics like Euclidean distance.  
- **Euclidean Distance** considers the actual difference in values, while correlation looks at the shape of the relationship.  

```{r}
# Compute distance matrix using Euclidean distance
sampleDists <- dist(t(normcounts[selectedGenes,]))
sampleDistMatrix <- as.matrix(sampleDists)

# Visualize distance matrix with pheatmap
pheatmap::pheatmap(sampleDistMatrix,  
                   annotation_col = df, 
                   cutree_cols = 3, cutree_rows = 3, 
                   show_colnames = FALSE, show_rownames = FALSE,
                   main = "Sample Distance Heatmap")
```


## 4.2 Clustering  

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar samples together based on their features (genes in our case).In this section, we will explore two popular clustering techniques:  
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to show relationships between clusters.  
- **K-means Clustering**: Divides samples into a predefined number of clusters (`k`) based on similarity.  

### Hierarchical Clustering  

Hierarchical clustering is performed in two main steps:  
1. **Calculate a distance matrix**: Compute the pairwise distance (or dissimilarity) between samples.  
2. **Linkage**: Merge samples or clusters based on their distance using a specific method (e.g., average or complete linkage).  

#### Step 1: Compute Distance Matrix  
The first step in hierarchical clustering is to calculate the distance between samples. Common distance metrics include:  
- **Euclidean Distance**: The straight-line distance between two points.  
- **Manhattan Distance**: The sum of absolute differences between coordinates.  
- **Correlation Distance**: Measures similarity in terms of their trends or patterns, regardless of their actual values.

```{r}
# Make sample names informative
rownames(normcounts.top1Kvar) <- paste0(metadata$disease, "_", metadata$severity, "_", metadata$gender, "_", seq(1:nrow(normcounts.top1Kvar)))  

# Calculate Euclidean distance matrix for the top 1000 most variable genes
dist_mat <- dist(normcounts.top1Kvar, method = "euclidean")
```

#### Step 2: Perform Hierarchical Clustering  
After computing the distance matrix, we can cluster the samples using different linkage methods:  
- **Single Linkage**: Smallest distance between any two samples in the clusters.  
- **Complete Linkage**: Largest distance between any two samples.  
- **Average Linkage**: Mean distance between all pairs of samples in two clusters.  
- **Ward's Method**: Minimizes the total variance within clusters.  

```{r}
# Perform hierarchical clustering using Average Linkage
hclust_avg <- hclust(dist_mat, method = "average")

# Perform hierarchical clustering using Ward's Method
hclust_ward <- hclust(dist_mat, method = "ward.D")
```

#### Step 3: Visualize Dendrogram  
Dendrograms are tree-like diagrams that show the clustering process.  
```{r}
# Plot dendrogram for Average Linkage
plot(hclust_avg, cex = 0.6, hang = -1, main = "Average Linkage Dendrogram")

# Add cluster rectangles (e.g., k = 2 clusters)
rect.hclust(hclust_avg, k = 2, border = "red")

# Plot dendrogram for Ward's Method
plot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6, hang = -1, main = "Ward's Method Dendrogram")

# Add cluster rectangles (e.g., k = 3 clusters)
rect.hclust(hclust_ward, k = 3, border = "blue")
```

#### Comparing Dendrograms  
Compare different linkage methods to see how clustering changes:  
```{r}
# Convert dendrograms to dendextend objects
dend_avg <- as.dendrogram(hclust_avg)
dend_ward <- as.dendrogram(hclust_ward)

# Compare using a tanglegram
tanglegram(dend_avg, dend_ward,
           common_subtrees_color_lines = TRUE,
           highlight_distinct_edges = TRUE,
           main_left = "Average Linkage",
           main_right = "Ward's Method")
```

### K-means Clustering  

K-means clustering divides samples into `k` clusters.  
- **Goal**: Minimize the distance between samples and their assigned cluster centroid.  
- **Centroid**: The center point of a cluster, recalculated iteratively as the mean of all samples in the cluster.  

#### Choosing the Number of Clusters (`k`)  
The number of clusters, `k`, must be defined in advance. Methods to select `k` include:  
- **Elbow Method**: Plot the within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) for different `k` values. Look for an "elbow" point where the WSS stops decreasing significantly.  
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how well samples are assigned to their clusters. Higher scores indicate better clustering.  

```{r}
# Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
fviz_nbclust(normcounts.top1Kvar, FUN = kmeans, method = "wss")
```

#### Perform K-means Clustering  
```{r}
# Run K-means clustering with k = 3
kmeans_out <- kmeans(normcounts.top1Kvar, centers = 3, nstart = 25)

# Visualize clusters
fviz_cluster(kmeans_out, data = normcounts.top1Kvar) +
  ggtitle("K-means Clustering (k = 3)")
```

#### Compare Results for Different `k` Values  
```{r}
# Run K-means for different values of k
kmeans_out2 <- kmeans(normcounts.top1Kvar, centers = 2, nstart = 25)
kmeans_out4 <- kmeans(normcounts.top1Kvar, centers = 4, nstart = 25)

# Plot results
p1 <- fviz_cluster(kmeans_out2, data = normcounts.top1Kvar) + ggtitle("k = 2")
p2 <- fviz_cluster(kmeans_out, data = normcounts.top1Kvar) + ggtitle("k = 3")
p3 <- fviz_cluster(kmeans_out4, data = normcounts.top1Kvar) + ggtitle("k = 4")

# Arrange plots side by side
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 1)
```



## 5. Complex Design  

When working with more complex datasets, we often need to include additional factors or explore the interactions between them.  
DESeq2 allows us to define **design formulas** that specify the variables and their relationships to be considered in the analysis.  

### Understanding the Design Matrix  
- The **design matrix** in statistics describes how each variable (factor) contributes to the model.  
- Variables in the design matrix can represent:  
  - **Main Effects**: The independent contribution of a variable (e.g., the effect of disease).  
  - **Interaction Terms**: The combined effect of two variables (e.g., the effect of disease depends on gender).  

In DESeq2, the `design` formula is written in R syntax:  
- `~ disease`: Includes only the disease variable (main effect).  
- `~ gender + disease`: Includes the effects of both gender and disease (additive model).  
- `~ gender * disease`: Includes gender, disease, and their interaction (interaction model).  
- `~ gender : disease`: Includes only the interaction term without the main effects.


### Example 1: Additive Model  
The additive model includes the main effects of two or more variables but assumes no interaction between them.  

```{r}
# Define design formula with two factors (additive model)
dds2 <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts, 
                               colData = metadata, 
                               design = ~ gender + disease,
                               tidy = TRUE)

# Perform differential expression analysis
dds2 <- DESeq(dds2)

# resultsNames(dds2)

# Shrink Log2 Fold Changes for disease effect
res2LFC <- lfcShrink(dds2, coef = "disease_COVID.19_vs_Healthy", type = "apeglm")
```

**Interpretation:**  
- The model adjusts for differences in gene expression due to gender before estimating the effect of disease.  
- This approach is useful when gender might influence the results and needs to be accounted for.  


#### Compare LFC for regular vs. complex DESeq2 analysis

Run this in the console:
```{r}
plot(resLFC$log2FoldChange, res2LFC$log2FoldChange)
idx <- identify(resLFC$log2FoldChange,res2LFC$log2FoldChange) # Identify Points in a Scatter Plot
```

```{r}
resLFC[idx,]
res2LFC[idx,]
```

```{r}
# ENSG00000282122 - IGHV7-4-1
g1 <- plotCounts(dds, gene=rownames(resLFC[idx,]), intgroup=c("disease", "gender", "severity"), returnData=TRUE)
g1$diseaseGender <- paste0(g1$disease, "-", g1$gender)
ggplot(g1, aes(diseaseGender, count)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=disease)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle("IGHV7-4-1")
```


### Example 2: Interaction Model  
An interaction model examines how one variable affects the relationship between another variable and the outcome.  

```{r}
# Define design formula with interaction terms
dds3 <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts, 
                               colData = metadata, 
                               design = ~ gender * disease,
                               tidy = TRUE)

# Perform differential expression analysis
dds3 <- DESeq(dds3)

# resultsNames(dds3)

# Examine results for interaction term
resInteraction <- results(dds3, name = "genderM.diseaseCOVID.19")
```

**Interpretation:**  
- The interaction term `genderMale.diseaseCOVID.19` tests whether the effect of disease is different for males compared to females.
- Interaction models are useful for exploring conditional effects or testing hypotheses about variable interactions.  


### Writing the Design Formula  
The design formula in DESeq2 should include all relevant variables and interactions based on your study design.  
- **Order Matters**: Variables are evaluated in the order they are written.  

Examples:  
- `~ disease`: Single-factor analysis.  
- `~ gender + disease`: Adjust for gender while testing for disease effects.  
- `~ gender * disease`: Include both main effects and their interaction.  
- `~ gender + severity + disease`: Adjust for both gender and severity.  


### Checking Results  
Use the `resultsNames()` function to list all available coefficients from the model:  
```{r}
# List coefficients
resultsNames(dds3)
```


### Key Takeaways  
- Use **additive models** when you want to adjust for multiple variables.  
- Use **interaction models** to explore relationships between variables.  
- Always write the design formula carefully to match your study question.  
- Check the `resultsNames()` output to ensure you’re interpreting the correct coefficients.  

## 6. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)  

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a method used to identify whether predefined gene sets show significant differences in expression between two conditions.  
- Instead of analyzing individual genes, GSEA focuses on groups of genes that share common biological functions, pathways, or other annotations.  
- This approach helps identify underlying biological mechanisms driving the observed changes in gene expression.  


### Steps in GSEA  
1. **Create an ordered gene list**: Rank genes by their differential expression (e.g., log2 fold change).  
2. **Define gene sets**: Use predefined collections of genes representing biological pathways (e.g., Hallmark gene sets).  
3. **Run enrichment analysis**: Test whether genes in each set are disproportionately represented at the top (or bottom) of the ordered list.  
4. **Visualize results**: Use plots to interpret enriched pathways.  


### Step 1: Create an Ordered Gene List  

```{r}
# Add gene symbols to results
res2LFC$symbol <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                        keys = rownames(resLFC),
                        column = "SYMBOL",
                        keytype = "ENSEMBL",
                        multiVals = "first")

# Create an ordered vector of genes by log2FoldChange
genes_ordered <- res2LFC %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(log2FoldChange, symbol) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  arrange(-log2FoldChange) %>%  # Rank genes in descending order of log2FC
  pull(log2FoldChange, name = symbol)
```


### Step 2: Define Gene Sets  
We will use the **Hallmark gene sets** from the `msigdbr` package, which represent well-defined biological processes.  

```{r}
# Load Hallmark pathways
hallmarks <- msigdbr(species = "Homo sapiens", category = "H") %>% 
  dplyr::select(gs_name, gene_symbol)  # Select pathway name and associated genes
hallmarks
```


### Step 3: Run GSEA  
Perform GSEA using the `GSEA()` function from the `clusterProfiler` package.  

```{r}
# Run GSEA
names(genes_ordered) <- make.unique(names(genes_ordered)) # Make gene names unique
gsea_results <- GSEA(genes_ordered, TERM2GENE = hallmarks, pvalueCutoff = 0.05)
```

**Parameters in GSEA:**  
- `genes_ordered`: The ranked gene list.  
- `TERM2GENE`: A data frame linking pathways (terms) to genes.  
- `pvalueCutoff`: Filters results to include only significantly enriched pathways.  


### Step 4: Visualize GSEA Results  
Visualize the enriched pathways using a dot plot:  

```{r}
# Dot plot visualization
dotplot(gsea_results, showCategory = 10, title = "Top 10 Enriched Pathways") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Dot Plot Interpretation:**  
- The size of the dots represents the number of genes in the pathway.  
- The color represents the adjusted p-value (darker colors = more significant).  

### Step 5: Explore Results  
Investigate specific pathways of interest. For example, to examine the enrichment plot for a particular pathway:  

```{r}
# Enrichment plot for a specific pathway
enrichplot::gseaplot2(gsea_results, geneSetID = "HALLMARK_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION")
```

**Interpretation of Enrichment Plot:**  
- **X-axis**: Genes ranked by log2 fold change.  
- **Y-axis**: Enrichment score showing the cumulative overlap with the pathway.  
- A peak indicates where most genes from the pathway are concentrated in the ranked list.  


### Key Takeaways  
- GSEA provides pathway-level insights into differential gene expression, revealing biological processes that might be driving the observed changes.  
- Use well-curated gene sets, such as the Hallmark pathways, for more robust results.  
- Visualizations like dot plots and enrichment plots help interpret enriched pathways effectively.  
- Always review the ranked gene list and enrichment scores critically to ensure biological relevance.
