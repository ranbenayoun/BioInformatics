!Series_summary	"Modern humans spend most of their time having eaten recently. The purpose of the current project is to understand how the blood, which contains immune cells, responds in the hours after eating a meal that is moderately high in fat. We used a sequencing method to observe the expression of all the genes in blood cells in five participants who were each fed a high fat meal on three separate days. The results are reported in the manuscript, “Temporal changes in postprandial blood transcriptomes reveal subject-specific pattern of expression of innate immunity genes after a high-fat meal."""
!Series_overall_design	"We used a sequencing method to observe the expression of all the genes in blood cells in five participants who were each fed a high fat meal on three separate days, resulting in 45 whole blood transcriptomes. For each sample, 3 mL of venous whole blood was drawn into a Tempus Blood RNA tube, shaken vigorously, and then frozen at -80°C until use. Total RNA was purified with the Tempus Spin RNA Isolation Kit with minor modifications to the manufacturer’s protocol. To remove residual genomic DNA, RNA samples were treated on-column with RNase-Free DNase per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity, quality, and integrity were assessed with NanoDrop 1000 and 2100 Bioanalyzer. All isolated RNA had A260/A280 ratios greater than 2 and RNA integrity numbers higher than 7.3. RNA-Seq libraries were constructed at the DNA Technologies and Expression Core at the University of California, Davis, using the Ovation Human Blood RNA-Seq Library System (NuGEN Technologies). Sequencing was performed in a 2x100bp format with 45 samples multiplexed on 3 lanes on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. Analysis of the data is reported in the manuscript, “Temporal changes in postprandial blood transcriptomes reveal subject-specific pattern of expression of innate immunity genes after a high-fat meal.”"

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1	"This investigation was a double blinded, placebo-controlled and randomized crossover study. Subjects were fed a test breakfast on the three test days in a random order with at least four weeks washout period between each test day. Subjects and study coordinators were blinded with respect to the treatments received with the test breakfast. Researchers handling samples and data did not know what treatments subjects received on all test days. The study diets were calculated by a registered dietitian using the Nutrition Data System for Research 2014 (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota) and produced using ProNutra (Viocare, Inc.) software programs. The registered dietitian coded the different test breakfasts, obtained a randomized list from a statistician, and assigned subjects sequentially as subject numbers were assigned. Subjects were instructed by a registered dietitian or study coordinator to follow a low polyphenol and low omega-3 FA diet and limit consumption of fruits; vegetables; soy; fatty fish (e.g., salmon); non-fatty fish, crustaceans, and mollusks (e.g., cod, lobster, clams, respectively); whole grains; flaxseed, walnut, canola, and other vegetable oils; nuts and seeds; coffee; tea; alcohol-based beverages; herbs, spices, and condiments; and chocolate starting 3 days before each test day. Participants were also allowed to take one study team-approved multivitamin per day that did not contain any added antioxidants (e.g., green tea extract). Between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on the night before each test day, subjects were instructed to eat a standardized dinner provided by the metabolic kitchen that included a sandwich (bagel, butter, egg patty, beef sausage, cheddar cheese), vanilla wafer cookies, chocolate-hazelnut spread, yogurt (yogurt, heavy cream, raspberry-flavored syrup), and lemonade. Subjects were instructed to refrain from eating or drinking anything after 8:00 p.m., except plain water; they were instructed to document the time they ate the meal and to document any deviations on the meal checklists provided with the meal. On each test day, subjects arrived at the WHNRC after a 12-h overnight fast. Subjects had their body temperature, blood pressure, and weight measured and had fasting blood withdrawn by venipuncture. Subjects were then fed a breakfast meal with a test smoothie supplemented with either placebo powder or blueberry powder and either placebo control oil or DHA oil. The breakfast meal included a sandwich (bagel, butter, egg patty, beef sausage, cheddar cheese) and vanilla wafer cookies. The test smoothie base used on all treatments contained nonfat milk, water, blackberry-flavored Italian soda syrup, heavy whipping cream, and xanthan gum. The test smoothie was supplemented with either placebo control powder (sucrose, wheat dextrin, artificial blueberry flavor, whey protein, high-oleic sunflower oil, maltodextrin, artificial red and blue food coloring, dextrose, ascorbic acid, citric acid, and silicon dioxide), placebo control oil (high-oleic sunflower oil), blueberry powder (freeze-dried 50/50 blend of Tifblue/Rubel (Vaccinium  virgatum (ashei)/Vaccinium corymbosum) blueberries), or DHA oil (algal vegetable oil from Schizochytrium sp.). The total energy of the meal and smoothie was 849 +/- 2.6 kcal with approx. 36.2% kcal from fat by calculation. This test meal is referred to as a high-fat  meal in this study. More specifically, it is a moderately high-fat, high-saturated-fat meal. The meals with the placebo, blueberry powder, or DHA smoothies contained 15.4 g, 15.4 g, or 14.9 g of saturated fat, respectively, primarily as palmitic acid and stearic acid. Subjects were given 20 min to consume the entire breakfast, after which they were provided water ad libitum and remained in the Metabolic Unit in the WHNRC until they completed the test day. Postprandial blood draws were conducted at 1, 3 and 6 h after consumption of the test meal."	"This investigation was a double blinded, placebo-controlled and randomized crossover study. Subjects were fed a test breakfast on the three test days in a random order with at least four weeks washout period between each test day. Subjects and study coordinators were blinded with respect to the treatments received with the test breakfast. Researchers handling samples and data did not know what treatments subjects received on all test days. The study diets were calculated by a registered dietitian using the Nutrition Data System for Research 2014 (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota) and produced using ProNutra (Viocare, Inc.) software programs.

Participants were also allowed to take one study team-approved multivitamin per day that did not contain any added antioxidants (e.g., green tea extract). Between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on the night before each test day, subjects were instructed to eat a standardized dinner provided by the metabolic kitchen that included a sandwich (bagel, butter, egg patty, beef sausage, cheddar cheese), vanilla wafer cookies, chocolate-hazelnut spread, yogurt (yogurt, heavy cream, raspberry-flavored syrup), and lemonade. Subjects were instructed to refrain from eating or drinking anything after 8:00 p.m., except plain water; they were instructed to document the time they ate the meal and to document any deviations on the meal checklists provided with the meal. On each test day, subjects arrived at the WHNRC after a 12-h overnight fast. Subjects had their body temperature, blood pressure, and weight measured and had fasting blood withdrawn by venipuncture. Subjects were then fed a breakfast meal with a test smoothie supplemented with either placebo powder or blueberry powder and either placebo control oil or DHA oil. The breakfast meal included a sandwich (bagel, butter, egg patty, beef sausage, cheddar cheese) and vanilla wafer cookies. The test smoothie base used on all treatments contained nonfat milk, water, blackberry-flavored Italian soda syrup, heavy whipping cream, and xanthan gum. The test smoothie was supplemented with either placebo control powder (sucrose, wheat dextrin, artificial blueberry flavor, whey protein, high-oleic sunflower oil, maltodextrin, artificial red and blue food coloring, dextrose, ascorbic acid, citric acid, and silicon dioxide), placebo control oil (high-oleic sunflower oil), blueberry powder (freeze-dried 50/50 blend of Tifblue/Rubel (Vaccinium  virgatum (ashei)/Vaccinium corymbosum) blueberries), or DHA oil (algal vegetable oil from Schizochytrium sp.). The total energy of the meal and smoothie was 849 +/- 2.6 kcal with approx. 36.2% kcal from fat by calculation. This test meal is referred to as a high-fat  meal in this study. More specifically, it is a moderately high-fat, high-saturated-fat meal. The meals with the placebo, blueberry powder, or DHA smoothies contained 15.4 g, 15.4 g, or 14.9 g of saturated fat, respectively, primarily as palmitic acid and stearic acid. Subjects were given 20 min to consume the entire breakfast, after which they were provided water ad libitum and remained in the Metabolic Unit in the WHNRC until they completed the test day. Postprandial blood draws were conducted at 1, 3 and 6 h after consumption of the test meal."	"This investigation was a double blinded, placebo-controlled and randomized crossover study.

The registered dietitian coded the different test breakfasts, obtained a randomized list from a statistician, and assigned subjects sequentially as subject numbers were assigned. Subjects were instructed by a registered dietitian or study coordinator to follow a low polyphenol and low omega-3 FA diet and limit consumption of fruits; vegetables; soy; fatty fish (e.g., salmon); non-fatty fish, crustaceans, and mollusks (e.g., cod, lobster, clams, respectively); whole grains; flaxseed, walnut, canola, and other vegetable oils; nuts and seeds; coffee; tea; alcohol-based beverages; herbs, spices, and condiments; and chocolate starting 3 days before each test day. Participants were also allowed to take one study team-approved multivitamin per day that did not contain any added antioxidants (e.g., green tea extract). Between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on the night before each test day, subjects were instructed to eat a standardized dinner provided by the metabolic kitchen that included a sandwich (bagel, butter, egg patty, beef sausage, cheddar cheese), vanilla wafer cookies, chocolate-hazelnut spread, yogurt (yogurt, heavy cream, raspberry-flavored syrup), and lemonade. Subjects were instructed to refrain from eating or drinking anything after 8:00 p.m., except plain water; they were instructed to document the time they ate the meal and to document any deviations on the meal checklists provided with the meal. On each test day, subjects arrived at the WHNRC after a 12-h overnight fast. Subjects had their body temperature, blood pressure, and weight measured and had fasting blood withdrawn by venipuncture. Subjects were then fed a breakfast meal with a test smoothie supplemented with either placebo powder or blueberry powder and either placebo control oil or DHA oil. The breakfast meal included a sandwich (bagel, butter, egg patty, beef sausage, cheddar cheese) and vanilla wafer cookies. The test smoothie base used on all treatments contained nonfat milk, water, blackberry-flavored Italian soda syrup, heavy whipping cream, and xanthan gum. The test smoothie was supplemented with either placebo control powder (sucrose, wheat dextrin, artificial blueberry flavor, whey protein, high-oleic sunflower oil, maltodextrin, artificial red and blue food coloring, dextrose, ascorbic acid, citric acid, and silicon dioxide), placebo control oil (high-oleic sunflower oil), blueberry powder (freeze-dried 50/50 blend of Tifblue/Rubel (Vaccinium  virgatum (ashei)/Vaccinium corymbosum) blueberries), or DHA oil (algal vegetable oil from Schizochytrium sp.). The total energy of the meal and smoothie was 849 +/- 2.6 kcal with approx. 36.2% kcal from fat by calculation. This test meal is referred to as a high-fat  meal in this study. More specifically, it is a moderately high-fat, high-saturated-fat meal. The meals with the placebo, blueberry powder, or DHA smoothies contained 15.4 g, 15.4 g, or 14.9 g of saturated fat, respectively, primarily as palmitic acid and stearic acid. Subjects were given 20 min to consume the entire breakfast, after which they were provided water ad libitum and remained in the Metabolic Unit in the WHNRC until they completed the test day. Postprandial blood draws were conducted at 1, 3 and 6 h after consumption of the test meal."	"This investigation was a double blinded, placebo-controlled and randomized crossover study.

The study diets were calculated by a registered dietitian using the Nutrition Data System for Research 2014 (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota) and produced using ProNutra (Viocare, Inc.) software programs. The registered dietitian coded the different test breakfasts, obtained a randomized list from a statistician, and assigned subjects sequentially as subject numbers were assigned. Subjects were instructed by a registered dietitian or study coordinator to follow a low polyphenol and low omega-3 FA diet and limit consumption of fruits; vegetables; soy; fatty fish (e.g., salmon); non-fatty fish, crustaceans, and mollusks (e.g., cod, lobster, clams, respectively); whole grains; flaxseed, walnut, canola, and other vegetable oils; nuts and seeds; coffee; tea; alcohol-based beverages; herbs, spices, and condiments; and chocolate starting 3 days before each test day. Participants were also allowed to take one study team-approved multivitamin per day that did not contain any added antioxidants (e.g., green tea extract). Between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on the night before each test day, subjects were instructed to eat a standardized dinner provided by the metabolic kitchen that included a sandwich (bagel, butter, egg patty, beef sausage, cheddar cheese), vanilla wafer cookies, chocolate-hazelnut spread, yogurt (yogurt, heavy cream, raspberry-flavored syrup), and lemonade. Subjects were instructed to refrain from eating or drinking anything after 8:00 p.m., except plain water; they were instructed to document the time they ate the meal and to document any deviations on the meal checklists provided with the meal. On each test day, subjects arrived at the WHNRC after a 12-h overnight fast. Subjects had their body temperature, blood pressure, and weight measured and had fasting blood withdrawn by venipuncture. Subjects were then fed a breakfast meal with a test smoothie supplemented with either placebo powder or blueberry powder and either placebo control oil or DHA oil. The breakfast meal included a sandwich (bagel, butter, egg patty, beef sausage, cheddar cheese) and vanilla wafer cookies. The test smoothie base used on all treatments contained nonfat milk, water, blackberry-flavored Italian soda syrup, heavy whipping cream, and xanthan gum. The test smoothie was supplemented with either placebo control powder (sucrose, wheat dextrin, artificial blueberry flavor, whey protein, high-oleic sunflower oil, maltodextrin, artificial red and blue food coloring, dextrose, ascorbic acid, citric acid, and silicon dioxide), placebo control oil (high-oleic sunflower oil), blueberry powder (freeze-dried 50/50 blend of Tifblue/Rubel (Vaccinium  virgatum (ashei)/Vaccinium corymbosum) blueberries), or DHA oil (algal vegetable oil from Schizochytrium sp.). The total energy of the meal and smoothie was 849 +/- 2.6 kcal with approx. 36.2% kcal from fat by calculation. This test meal is referred to as a high-fat  meal in this study. More specifically, it is a moderately high-fat, high-saturated-fat meal. The meals with the placebo, blueberry powder, or DHA smoothies contained 15.4 g, 15.4 g, or 14.9 g of saturated fat, respectively, primarily as palmitic acid and stearic acid. Subjects were given 20 min to consume the entire breakfast, after which they were provided water ad libitum and remained in the Metabolic Unit in the WHNRC until they completed the test day. Postprandial blood draws were conducted at 1, 3 and 6 h after consumption of the test meal."	"This investigation was a double blinded, placebo-controlled and randomized crossover study.

Researchers handling samples and data did not know what treatments subjects received on all test days. The study diets were calculated by a registered dietitian using the Nutrition Data System for Research 2014 (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota) and produced using ProNutra (Viocare, Inc.) software programs. The registered dietitian coded the different test breakfasts, obtained a randomized list from a statistician, and assigned subjects sequentially as subject numbers were assigned. Subjects were instructed by a registered dietitian or study coordinator to follow a low polyphenol and low omega-3 FA diet and limit consumption of fruits; vegetables; soy; fatty fish (e.g., salmon); non-fatty fish, crustaceans, and mollusks (e.g., cod, lobster, clams, respectively); whole grains; flaxseed, walnut, canola, and other vegetable oils; nuts and seeds; coffee; tea; alcohol-based beverages; herbs, spices, and condiments; and chocolate starting 3 days before each test day. Participants were also allowed to take one study team-approved multivitamin per day that did not contain any added antioxidants (e.g., green tea extract). Between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on the night before each test day, subjects were instructed to eat a standardized dinner provided by the metabolic kitchen that included a sandwich (bagel, butter, egg patty, beef sausage, cheddar cheese), vanilla wafer cookies, chocolate-hazelnut spread, yogurt (yogurt, heavy cream, raspberry-flavored syrup), and lemonade. Subjects were instructed to refrain from eating or drinking anything after 8:00 p.m., except plain water; they were instructed to document the time they ate the meal and to document any deviations on the meal checklists provided with the meal. On each test day, subjects arrived at the WHNRC after a 12-h overnight fast. Subjects had their body temperature, blood pressure, and weight measured and had fasting blood withdrawn by venipuncture. Subjects were then fed a breakfast meal with a test smoothie supplemented with either placebo powder or blueberry powder and either placebo control oil or DHA oil. The breakfast meal included a sandwich (bagel, butter, egg patty, beef sausage, cheddar cheese) and vanilla wafer cookies. The test smoothie base used on all treatments contained nonfat milk, water, blackberry-flavored Italian soda syrup, heavy whipping cream, and xanthan gum. The test smoothie was supplemented with either placebo control powder (sucrose, wheat dextrin, artificial blueberry flavor, whey protein, high-oleic sunflower oil, maltodextrin, artificial red and blue food coloring, dextrose, ascorbic acid, citric acid, and silicon dioxide), placebo control oil (high-oleic sunflower oil), blueberry powder (freeze-dried 50/50 blend of Tifblue/Rubel (Vaccinium  virgatum (ashei)/Vaccinium corymbosum) blueberries), or DHA oil (algal vegetable oil from Schizochytrium sp.). The total energy of the meal and smoothie was 849 +/- 2.6 kcal with approx. 36.2% kcal from fat by calculation. This test meal is referred to as a high-fat  meal in this study. More specifically, it is a moderately high-fat, high-saturated-fat meal. The meals with the placebo, blueberry powder, or DHA smoothies contained 15.4 g, 15.4 g, or 14.9 g of saturated fat, respectively, primarily as palmitic acid and stearic acid. Subjects were given 20 min to consume the entire breakfast, after which they were provided water ad libitum and remained in the Metabolic Unit in the WHNRC until they completed the test day. Postprandial blood draws were conducted at 1, 3 and 6 h after consumption of the test meal."	"This investigation was a double blinded, placebo-controlled and randomized crossover study.
